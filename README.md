# Nepal_Earthquake_Classification_Model

## Project Objective

This project leverages Nepal Earthquake data available on Kaggle to develop predictive models. Importing the data from PostgreSQL, the goal is to predict the likelihood of a building experiencing specific damage levels in the event of an earthquake. The predictive model considers various characteristics of buildings to make these predictions. Perticular Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier used in this project. In conclusion the model performance, comparision and best model for this data.
